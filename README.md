# [Elocyclo](https://elocyclo.vogelino.com)
Elocyclo is the website of a fictive bike renting service in Montreux, Switzerland.
This website is part of the creation of a whole corporate identity done as the final exam of my multimedia design studies at [the Romand School for Arts & Communication (ERACOM)](http://www.eracom.ch/) in July 2012.

This website was originally written in PHP and has been rewritten in Javascript for the sake of simplifying it and making easier to serve on servers. The website doesn't include real contents and is purely fictive.
